# PruLogin

# Architecure
Used MVP pattern to separate business logics out from Activity, allowing for unit tests. 
As for unit tests, I used junit 4 and Mockito (to mock objects)

# Animation
For login screen's floating labels on top of the input fields, I used android.support.design.TextInputLayout 
I tried not to reinvent the wheels as it would result in inefficiency and complication.
